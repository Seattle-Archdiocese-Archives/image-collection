## About The Archdiocese of Seattle Archives

The [Archdiocese of Seattle](https://archseattle.org/) encompasses all of Western Washington from border to border, west of the Cascade Mountains to the Pacific Ocean.


The [Archives](https://archseattle.org/about-the-archdiocese-of-seattle/archives-and-records-management-public/) collects records and other materials that reflect the history and administration of the Archdiocese of Seattle from the 1840s to the present day. Some of the broad areas documented include:


* The pastoral and administrative affairs of past bishops and clergy of the Archdiocese of Seattle.
* The work of Chancery offices and archdiocesan programs.
* Our positions on important religious, social and political issues over time.
* The founding and administration of parishes and schools.
* The sacramental life of local Catholics.
* Relationships with other institutions, organizations and lay Catholic groups.
